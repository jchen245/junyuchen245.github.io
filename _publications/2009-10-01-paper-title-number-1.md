We treat CNN as an optimization tool that iteratively minimizes the loss function via reparametrization in each iteration. This means that the algorithm is fully unsupervised and thus **no prior training is required**. We generate phantom variations by warpping an XCAT phantom to capture the anatomical variations within the real human CT images.
