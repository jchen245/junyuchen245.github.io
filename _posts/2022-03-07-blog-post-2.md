2. ***-Acupuncture and tai chi may help improve quality of life and certain pain conditions. Studies of Chinese herbal products used in TCM for a range of medical conditions have had mixed results.***\

3. ***-Researchers at the University of Maryland school of medicine in Baltimore surveyed 70 systematic reviews measuring the effectiveness of traditional medicines, including acupuncture. None of those studies could reach a solid conclusion because the evidence was either too sparse or of poor quality.***\
   ***-For most conditions, there is not enough rigorous scientific evidence to know whether TCM methods work for the conditions for which they are used.***
