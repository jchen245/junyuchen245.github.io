ABOUT MYSELF
====
I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University, I am currently working for <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/radiology/research/divisions/radiological-physics/our-team.html">Radiological Physics Division</a> as a Graduate Research Assistant in the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/radiology/index.html">Russell H. Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science</a> at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, adivsed by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_-K45vUAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Eric C. Frey</a>. I'm also working at <a href="https://www.research.us.medical.canon/"> Canon Medical Research USA, Inc.</a> (full-time in Summer 2020, part-time in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021), as a PET Image Reconstruction and Quality Scientist Intern, where I am supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h5ZNDBUAAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Evren Asma</a> and mentored by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Or4xII0AAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Chung (Jan) Chan</a>.

I received my dual B.Sc. degrees with <a href="http://catalog.ncsu.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies-procedures/student-status-honors/academic-honors/">Summa Cum Laude</a> honors in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/">North Carolina State University</a> in 2017, and my M.S.E. degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering from <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/">Johns Hopkins University</a> in 2019, I then became a Ph.D. student there.
